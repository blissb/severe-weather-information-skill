            <p> CUSTOM VERSION - Filtering should be off.
            Filtering by location is highly recommended as weather services might provide lots of warnings for areas far away from your location.
            "Mycroft device" will use longitude/latitude from the device configuration.
            "Area description" is very often the name of a city/county/region - don't forget to enter description in field "Location (description)"
            "Geo-Code" is dependant on the service, e.g. UGC, Emma-Id or NUTS3 - enter the actual code-value in field "Location (description)" without the Geo-Code name.

            When automatic alert is turned on Mycroft will perform scheduled updates, e.g. every 10 minutes.
            In case alerts for extreme or severe conditions with immediate urgency are observed
            Mycroft will speak the alerts headline and instructions automatically.

            When choosing service 'ZZZ - Custom' in Options section above then you can specify the service URL here.
            Given URL must include http/https-prefix and point to a webservice that provides a RSS or AtomPub feed
            where the entries are in CAP format (Common Alerting Protocol).
            All settings in Options section (e.g. language, location, etc.) do still apply.
